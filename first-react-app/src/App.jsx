import { useEffect, useState } from "react"

// automatically imported built in feature
// any thing that starts with use is a hook
// hook are special function that let you use react features like state management

// new and recommended way

// state is like a react components brain
// they are reset after reload
// these are components that can change our time
const Card = ({ title }) => {
  // const [varName, setVar] = hook();
  // setVar is function that changes the varName.

  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(`${title} Is Liked? ${hasLiked}`);
  }, [hasLiked]);// in "[]" we pass the value on change of which the useEffect will take place

  // common Use case 
  // it runs only one when mounting this component
  // for now it will run each time the card func is called
  // useEffect(() => {
  //   console.log("CARD RENDERED");
  // },[])

    </div>

// useEffect hook
// it lets you fetch data or delete component


// "<>" are called react fragments we can just use a normal div in place as well.
// i am already hating the debugging :(
